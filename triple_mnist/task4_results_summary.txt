- TASK 4: MODEL ENHANCEMENT RESULTS
Enhancement Techniques Applied:
1. Data Augmentation:
   - Rotation range: ±10 degrees
   - Width/height shifts: ±10%
   - Zoom range: ±10%

2. Enhanced CNN Architecture:
   - Increased model complexity (more filters and layers)
   - Added batch normalization for training stability
   - Increased dropout for better regularization
   - Learning rate scheduling for more effective training
